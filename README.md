# lugha
A Flask project that stores and parses dictionary info from Wiktionary (using [Suyash458's WiktionaryParser](https://github.com/Suyash458/WiktionaryParser), slightly modded) as per users' requests and help users build their vocabulary by reviewing word cards (using [alankan886's SuperMemo2](https://github.com/alankan886/SuperMemo2) to calculate the next review time).
